    		<h1>UTOPIA</h1>
    	</div>
    
    	<p>
			It is an age of wartime and hostility where several
			kingdoms exist, with each kingdom made up of several
			individual provinces working together as a team.
			Each kingdom can hold up to 25 different provinces.
			Each province is run by a different individual which
			has the ability to create the province's and ruler's 
			name.  The individual can possibly get the luxury of 
			picking from a variety of races and personalities to 
			play.  Depending on the kingdom where that individual 
			plays in, the kingdom's setup (race and personality)
			is determined by the monarch and stewards of that
			kingdom.  The goal is to be the best kingdom in Utopia.
			There are goals that can be accomplished by provinces
			and by kingdoms.  Winning the war crown, having highest
			networth, highest honor, and highest land rank. Each 
			age can last up to three months usually.  Come and join
			the thousands of players today play Utopia- A world of 
			intrigue, strategy, and warfare.  While at it, try your
			luck at being the best...
		</p>

		<p>
			Each age in Utopia brings a variety of different races
			and personalities that an individual can choose from.  
			Some of the races includes:  Orc, Undead, Elf, Dwarf, 
			etc.  Some of the personalities includes:  Sage, Rogue,
			Warrior, Cleric, etc.  Each race and personality has its
			own pros and cons.  What makes Utopia interesting is the 
			variety of races and personalities that kingdoms can come 
			up with to win wars.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each individual has the ability to make changes to how
			their province runs.  For example, you can chose how many
			soldiers to train into offensive and defensive units as
			well as how many elites and thieves you want to have.  You
			can also build your barren acres into a variety of 
			buildings that will help make your province thrive.  At 
			your fingertips, you can cast spells with your wizards, 
			steal with your thieves, and attack with your military.
